I'm developing the backend part of a web service, and the primary programming language I use is Java with the Spring Framework. I also frequently use JavaScript with NodeJS. I have a strong interest in DevOps, and I enjoy pondering and solving how to automate service operations and ensure stable performance. When it comes to DevOps tasks, I find satisfaction in improvising solutions on the spot based on the specific circumstances that arise, making it a rewarding challenge for me.
